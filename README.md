=================

This project is a summary of this back-end trimester: authentication, NodeJS, MongoDB, Redis, pagination and background processing.

The objective is to build a simple platform to upload and view files:

    User authentication via a token
    List all files
    Upload a new file
    Change permission of a file
    View a file
    Generate thumbnails for images

You will be guided step by step for building it, but you have some freedoms of implementation, split in more files etcâ€¦
